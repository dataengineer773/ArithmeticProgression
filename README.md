the classic Iterationpattern is all about traversal navigating some data structure, i have show a few consol tests of an ArithmeticOrogress class , ArithmeticProgression(begin, step, [, end]) and the complete signature of the range built-in is range(start, stop, [, step])
i also camged  the argumnet names from start/stop to begin/end to make it clear that i opted for a diffrent signature...
